Incorporating moment.js into your Astro website can bring a new level of user-friendliness to your date and time presentations.

To start, follow these steps:

**Install moment.js**

Begin by installing moment.js using the command **`npm install moment --save`**. This package will equip your project with the necessary tools.

**Implementation in Components**Identify the component within your website where you wish to implement the date changes. Utilize the **`moment()`** function, which accepts two key arguments: the date itself and the desired format, e.g., **`moment("20111031", "YYYYMMDD")`**.

**Leveraging `fromNow()`**

The true magic happens with the **`fromNow()`** function. Apply it to your date structure, such as

 

```jsx
moment("20111031", "YYYYMMDD").fromNow() // 12 years ago
```

This function converts your date into a user-friendly relative format, making it easily understandable.
